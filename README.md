# pasteview

Goal of project: Make reading pastes from Pastebin more enjoyable.

* customize reading area
* customize font size
* customize background and font color
* save settings (on page reload you have your old settings) and reset settings

## Todo's:

* touch up the style, especially for mobile users
* in addition to reset, add custom settings (light/dark/... mode)
